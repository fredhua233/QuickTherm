Quick Therm is a system comprised of a wearable armband and a mobile app to allow users, mainly elders, to easily monitor and predict their health trends, as well as to detect COVID-19 early. The app is written with Dart using Flutter for the frontend and Google Cloud Firestore NoSQL database as the backend. The prototype module is built with ATtiny85 for main computation and control, a temperature sensor or thermistor to detect user temperature, and a Bluetooth Low Energy chip to communicate with the user's phone. As of now, Quick Therm is able to measure temperature data, with the ability to measure blood oxygen level, heart rate in development, and blood pressure planned for the future.
